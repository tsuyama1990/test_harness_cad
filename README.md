This repository contains the backend for the KiCad Harness Design SaaS application. It is a FastAPI-based service responsible for programmatically generating KiCad schematic (`.kicad_sch`) files from JSON data and exporting manufacturing outputs like DXF and BOM files using `kicad-cli`.

This initial implementation serves as a technical spike (Cycle 0) to validate the core workflow.

## API Documentation

Once the application is running, API documentation is automatically generated by FastAPI and available at:

-   **Swagger UI:** [`/docs`](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)
-   **ReDoc:** [`/redoc`](http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc)

## Harness API

The core of this service is the Harness API, which establishes a "Single Source of Truth" for harness data.

-   `POST /api/v1/harnesses/`: Creates a new harness definition from a detailed JSON object.
-   `PUT /api/v1/harnesses/{harness_id}`: Updates an existing harness definition by replacing it with the provided JSON object.
-   `GET /api/v1/harnesses/{harness_id}/bom`: Returns a Bill of Materials for the specified harness.
-   `GET /api/v1/harnesses/{harness_id}/cutlist`: Returns a wire cutlist for the harness.
-   `GET /api/v1/harnesses/{harness_id}/fromto`: Returns a from-to connection list for the harness.
-   `GET /api/v1/harnesses/{harness_id}/strip-list`: Returns a CSV file with wire stripping information.
-   `GET /api/v1/harnesses/{harness_id}/mark-tube-list`: Returns a CSV file with marking tube information.
-   `GET /api/v1/harnesses/{harness_id}/formboard-pdf`: Returns a PDF file of the formboard.
-   `GET /api/v1/components`: Returns a list of available components (connectors, wires) for the frontend component library.

## Project Structure

The project follows a clean architecture to separate concerns:

-   `/app`: Main application code.
    -   `/api`: FastAPI endpoints and routers.
    -   `/core`: Configuration management.
    -   `/db`: Database session and base model definitions.
    -   `/models`: SQLAlchemy ORM models.
    -   `/schemas`: Pydantic schemas for data validation.
    -   `/services`: Core business logic, including the `KiCadEngineService`.
-   `/tests`: Pytest test suite for the backend.
-   `/alembic`: Alembic database migration scripts.
-   `/frontend`: React-based frontend application for the interactive harness editor.

## Frontend Application

The project includes a frontend application built with React, TypeScript, and Vite, located in the `/frontend` directory. It provides an interactive, web-based editor for creating and modifying harness designs.

### Running the Frontend

To run the frontend development server:

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start the Vite development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

The frontend application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or the next available port). It is configured to proxy API requests to the backend server running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### Running E2E Tests

The End-to-End (E2E) tests use Playwright to simulate real user interactions in a live environment. This requires both the backend and frontend servers to be running.

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    In your first terminal, navigate to the project root and run the FastAPI server:
    ```bash
    # Make sure you are in the project root directory
    source .venv/bin/activate
    uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
    ```

2.  **Start the Frontend Server:**
    In a second terminal, navigate to the `frontend` directory and run the Vite dev server:
    ```bash
    # Make sure you are in the frontend directory
    cd frontend
    npm run dev
    ```

3.  **Run the Playwright Tests:**
    Once both servers are running, open a third terminal, navigate to the `frontend` directory, and execute the tests:
    ```bash
    # Make sure you are in the frontend directory
    cd frontend
    npm run test:e2e
    ```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.10+
-   KiCad 7.x or later (for `kicad-cli` to be available in the system's PATH).
-   `uv` (or `pip` and `venv`).

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd kicad-harness-saas
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:**

    Using `uv`:
    ```bash
    uv venv
    uv pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    Or using `venv` and `pip`:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **(Optional) Environment Variables:**

    The application uses a `.env` file for configuration. A default `DATABASE_URL` is provided, but you can create a `.env` file to override settings:

    ```
    DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///./your_database_name.db"
    ```

### Running the Application

To run the development server:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### Running Tests

To run the test suite:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
pytest
```

The tests include mocks for `kicad-cli` and `kicad-sch-api` and can be run without a full KiCad installation.
